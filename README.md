**Rock-Paper-Scissors Game **

### Overview
Explore the development of a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Java. This project emphasizes essential programming concepts, randomization, user interaction, and basic game mechanics, resulting in a fun and interactive application.

### Key Features

**Game Mechanics:**
- Implements the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.
- Determines the winner based on player and computer choices.

**Randomization:**
- Utilizes the `Random` class to generate the computer's moves, ensuring an unpredictable and fair game.

**User Interaction:**
- Accepts user input for their choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Displays the result of each round and updates scores accordingly.

**Score Tracking:**
- Maintains and displays separate scores for the player and the computer.

### Approach

**Game Setup:**
- Define constants for the possible choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
- Initialize variables for tracking scores and the computer's current choice.

**Game Logic:**
- Generate random moves for the computer.
- Compare user and computer choices to determine the winner based on predefined rules.
- Update and display the scores after each round.

**User Input Handling:**
- Ensure valid user input.
- Provide clear prompts and feedback to enhance user experience.

### Best Performing Features

**Random Move Generation:**
- The use of `Random` ensures that the computer's moves are unpredictable, creating a challenging game for the player.

**Clear Result Determination:**
- Straightforward logic for comparing moves ensures accurate and quick result calculation.

**Score Tracking:**
- Real-time score updates keep the game engaging and competitive.

### Insights and Discoveries

**Simple Yet Engaging:**
- Even a simple game like Rock-Paper-Scissors can provide valuable lessons in programming logic and user interaction.

**Randomization Importance:**
- Ensuring unpredictability in computer choices makes the game more interesting and fair.

**User Feedback:**
